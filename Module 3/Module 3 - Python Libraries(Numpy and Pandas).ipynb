    "\n",
    "Normally, a library is a collection of books or is a room or place where many books are stored to be used later. Similarly, in the programming world, a library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. Other than pre-compiled codes, a library may contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python library is a collection of related modules. It contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. It makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. As we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc."

    "Data cleaning means fixing bad data in your data set. When working with multiple data sources, there are many chances for data to be incorrect, duplicated, or mislabeled. If data is wrong, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. Data cleaning is the process of changing or eliminating garbage, incorrect, duplicate, corrupted, or incomplete data in a dataset. There’s no such absolute way to describe the precise steps in the data cleaning process because the processes may vary from dataset to dataset. Data cleansing, data cleansing, or data scrub is that the initiative among the general data preparation process. Data cleaning plays an important part in developing reliable answers and within the analytical process and is observed to be a basic feature of the info science basics. The motive of data cleaning services is to construct uniform and standardized data sets that enable data analytical tools and business intelligence easy access and perceive accurate data for each problem.\n",
